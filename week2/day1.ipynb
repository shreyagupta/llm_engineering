       "\n",
       "## 1. Nature of the Problem\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Text-centric**: Is the problem primarily about understanding, generating, or analyzing natural language text?\n",
       "- **Unstructured Data**: Does the problem involve unstructured data such as emails, reports, chat logs, or documents?\n",
       "- **Complex Language Tasks**: Tasks like summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, content generation, or conversational interfaces are good candidates.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Availability and Quality of Data\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Sufficient Text Data**: Do you have enough relevant text data to fine-tune or prompt the LLM effectively?\n",
       "- **Data Privacy**: Can you securely handle sensitive or proprietary text data within the constraints of the chosen LLM solution?\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. Problem Complexity and Scope\n",
       "\n",
       "- **High Variability**: Problems with high variability in input (e.g., customer support queries) benefit from LLM flexibility.\n",
       "- **Contextual Understanding Needed**: If the problem requires understanding subtle context, idioms, or complex instructions, LLMs excel.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 4. Performance Requirements\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Accuracy Needs**: Is approximate or probabilistic output acceptable, or do you need deterministic, 100% correct answers?\n",
       "- **Real-time Processing**: Can the latency of LLM inference meet business requirements?\n",
       "\n",
       "## 5. Integration and Cost Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Integration Feasibility**: Can the LLM be integrated into existing workflows or systems?\n",
       "- **Cost**: Consider computational and licensing costs associated with deploying LLMs.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 6. Alternatives and Hybrid Approaches\n",
       "\n",
       "- If the problem can be solved by simpler rule-based systems or traditional ML models with good accuracy, those might be more efficient.\n",
       "- Sometimes, combining LLMs with other techniques yields better results.\n",
